## Goals:
1. Write custom ResNet architecture for CIFAR 10
2. Use LR search to find optimal learning rate
3. Use OneCycle LR scheduling with LR max and min found from the previous step
4. Train for 24 Epochs in total with max LR reached at the 5th Epoch
5. Use padding, randomCrop, FlipLR and Cutout for augmentations & Batch size of 512
6. Target Accuracy of 93%
